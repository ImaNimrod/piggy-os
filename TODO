Inital TODO list (5/2/24)

The goal is to get the kernel to load and run a static ELF binary from a limine module.
By this point, the process and thread functionality should be implemented such that following
syscalls are correctly implemented:
    - fork, exit, yield, getpid, gettid, thread_create, thread_sleep, thread_exit

All functionality regarding the VFS and filesystem drivers will be taken care of later.
The same can be said for a grand unified timer abstraction/API and a network stack.
